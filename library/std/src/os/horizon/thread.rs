//! Nintendo 3DS-specific extensions to primitives in the [`std::thread`] module.
//!
//! All 3DS models have at least two CPU cores available to spawn threads on:
//! The application core (appcore) and the system core (syscore). The New 3DS
//! has an additional two cores, the first of which can also run user-created
//! threads.
//!
//! Threads spawned on the appcore are cooperative rather than preemptive. This
//! means that threads must explicitly yield control to other threads (whether
//! via synchronization primitives or explicit calls to `yield_now`) when they
//! are not actively performing work. Failure to do so may result in control
//! flow being stuck in an inactive thread while the other threads are powerless
//! to continue their work.
//!
//! However, it is possible to spawn one fully preemptive thread on the syscore
//! by using a service call to reserve a slice of time for a thread to run.
//! Attempting to run more than one thread at a time on the syscore will result
//! in an error.
//!
