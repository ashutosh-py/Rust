   = note: shared references to mutable statics are dangerous since if there's any kind of mutation of, or mutable reference created for, that static while the reference lives, that's undefined behavior
   = note: `#[warn(static_mut_refs)]` on by default
help: use `addr_of!` instead to create a raw pointer
