LL |     let log = 2;
   |         ^^^ ambiguous name

   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
   = note: for more information, see issue #114095 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/114095>
   = note: ambiguous because of multiple glob imports of a name in the same module
note: `log` could refer to the function defined here
