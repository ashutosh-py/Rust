warning: creating a mutable reference to mutable static is discouraged

LL |     unsafe { &mut GLOBAL_MUT_T }
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ mutable reference to mutable static

   = note: for more information, see issue #114447 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/114447>
   = note: this will be a hard error in the 2024 edition
   = note: mutable references to mutable statics are dangerous since if there's any other pointer used or reference created for that static while the reference lives, that's undefined behavior
   = note: `#[warn(static_mut_refs)]` on by default
help: use `addr_of_mut!` instead to create a raw pointer
