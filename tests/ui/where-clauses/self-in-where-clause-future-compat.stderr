error: the trait `Trait` cannot be made into an object

   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
   = note: for more information, see issue #51443 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51443>
note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

LL |     fn unsafe_trait_bound(&self) where (): UnsafeTrait<Self> {}
   |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ...because method `unsafe_trait_bound` references the `Self` type in its `where` clause
   = help: consider moving `unsafe_trait_bound` to another trait
