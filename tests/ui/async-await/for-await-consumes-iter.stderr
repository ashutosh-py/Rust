error[E0382]: use of moved value: `iter`
  --> $DIR/for-await-consumes-iter.rs:14:20
   |
LL |     let iter = core::stream::from_iter(0..3);
   |         ---- move occurs because `iter` has type `std::stream::FromIter<std::ops::Range<i32>>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
LL |     let mut count = 0;
LL |     for await i in iter {
   |                    ---- `iter` moved due to this method call

   |                    ^^^^ value used here after move
   |
note: `into_stream` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `iter`
  --> $SRC_DIR/core/src/stream/stream.rs:LL:COL
help: you can `clone` the value and consume it, but this might not be your desired behavior
