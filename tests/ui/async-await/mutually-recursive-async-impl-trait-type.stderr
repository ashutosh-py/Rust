error[E0733]: recursion in an async fn requires boxing

LL | async fn rec_2() {
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
LL |     rec_1().await;
   |     ------------- recursive call here

note: which leads to this async fn

LL | async fn rec_1() {
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
LL |     rec_2().await;
   |     ------------- ...leading to this recursive call
   = note: a recursive `async fn` call must introduce indirection such as `Box::pin` to avoid an infinitely sized future
   = note: consider using the `async_recursion` crate: https://crates.io/crates/async_recursion
