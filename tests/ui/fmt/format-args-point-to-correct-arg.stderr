LL |     println!("test: {x} {x:?}");
   |                          ^ `X` cannot be formatted using `{:?}`
   |
   = help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `X`
   = note: add `#[derive(Debug)]` to `X` or manually `impl Debug for X`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider annotating `X` with `#[derive(Debug)]`
