   = note: extern statics are not controlled by the Rust type system: invalid data, aliasing violations or data races will cause undefined behavior

warning: `extern` block uses type `extern "rust-intrinsic" fn()`, which is not FFI-safe

   = help: consider using an `extern fn(...) -> ...` function pointer instead
   = note: this function pointer has Rust-specific calling convention
   = note: `#[warn(improper_ctypes)]` on by default
