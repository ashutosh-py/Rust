error[E0277]: the size for values of type `[f32]` cannot be known at compilation time

LL |     let x: [ScalableSimdFloat; 2];
   |            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ doesn't have a size known at compile-time
   |
   = help: within `ScalableSimdFloat`, the trait `Sized` is not implemented for `[f32]`, which is required by `ScalableSimdFloat: Sized`
note: required because it appears within the type `ScalableSimdFloat`
  --> $DIR/disallow-array.rs:4:12

LL | pub struct ScalableSimdFloat {
   |            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = note: slice and array elements must have `Sized` type
