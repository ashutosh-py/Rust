#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

Using a user-defined operator on const/static variable is restricted to what
can be evaluated at compile-time. Using an user-defined operator could call a
user-defined function, which is not allowed.

Bad example:

```compile_fail,E0015
use std::ops::Index;

struct Foo { a: u8 }

impl ::std::ops::Index<u8> for Foo {
    type Output = u8;
    fn index<'a>(&'a self, idx: u8) -> &'a u8 { &self.a }
}

const a: Foo = Foo { a: 0u8 };
const b: u8 = a[0]; // Index trait is defined by the user, bad!
```

Only operators on builtin types are allowed.

Example:

```
const a: &'static [i32] = &[1, 2, 3];
const b: i32 = a[0]; // Good!
```
