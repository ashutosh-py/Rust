Expected type did not match the received type.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0308
let x: i32 = "I am not a number!";
//     ~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//      |             |
//      |    initializing expression;
//      |    compiler infers type `&str`
//      |
//    type `i32` assigned to variable `x`
```

This error occurs when the compiler was unable to infer the concrete type of a
variable. It can occur for several cases, the most common of which is a
mismatch in the expected type that the compiler inferred for a variable's
initializing expression, and the actual type explicitly assigned to the
variable.

One possible scenario is that we have a trait and want to use multiple
implementors conditionally via dynamic dispatch. E. g.

```compile_fail,E0308
use std::{io, fs, env};

let arg = env::args().nth(1);

let mut input = if arg == "-" {
    std::io::stdin()
} else {
    fs::File::open(arg)?
    // expected struct `std::io::Stdin`, found struct `std::fs::File
};
// - if and else have incompatible types

Ok::<(), io::Error>(())
```

In many cases, the trait methods use self by (mutable) reference. Thus we can
create a `dyn` reference, but we need two variables for the actual objects,
because as shown above, one variable can only hold one type of object. We must
still declare the variables outside of the `if` to make sure they live long
enough.

Note that this relies on the fact that while one needs to initialize a value to
use it, Rust is clever enough to allow unused values to stay uninitialized:

```no_run
use std::{io, fs, env};

let arg = env::args().nth(1).unwrap_or("-".into());

// We only declare, not initialize the values.
let (mut stdin, mut file);

// We need to ascribe the type here to select dynamic dispatch.
let input: &mut dyn io::Read = if arg == "-" {
    stdin = std::io::stdin();
    &mut stdin
} else {
    file = fs::File::open(arg)?;
    &mut file
};
Ok::<(), io::Error>(())
```
