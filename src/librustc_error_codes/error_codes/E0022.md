#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

Constant functions are not allowed to mutate anything. Thus, binding to an
argument with a mutable pattern is not allowed. For example,

```
const fn foo(mut x: u8) {
    // do stuff
}
```

Is incorrect because the function body may not mutate `x`.

Remove any mutable bindings from the argument list to fix this error. In case
you need to mutate the argument, try lazily initializing a global variable
instead of using a `const fn`, or refactoring the code to a functional style to
avoid mutation if possible.
