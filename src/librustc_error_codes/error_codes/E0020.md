#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

This error indicates that an attempt was made to divide by zero (or take the
remainder of a zero divisor) in a static or constant expression. Erroneous
code example:

```compile_fail
#[deny(const_err)]

const X: i32 = 42 / 0;
// error: attempt to divide by zero in a constant expression
```
