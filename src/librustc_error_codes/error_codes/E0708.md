async` non-`move` closures with parameters are not currently supported

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0710
#![feature(async_closure)]

fn main() {
    let add_one = async |num: u8| {
        num + 1
    };
}
```

`async` with non-move currently not supported with the current
version, you can use successfully by using move:

```
#![feature(async_closure)]

fn main() {
    let add_one = async move |num: u8| {
        num + 1
    };
}
```
