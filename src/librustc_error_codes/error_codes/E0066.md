#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

Box placement expressions (like C++'s "placement new") do not yet support any
place expression except the exchange heap (i.e. `std::boxed::HEAP`).
Furthermore, the syntax is changing to use `in` instead of `box`. See [RFC 470]
and [RFC 809] for more details.
