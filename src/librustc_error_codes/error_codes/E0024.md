#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

This error indicates that a pattern attempted to extract the fields of an enum
variant with no fields. Here's a tiny example of this error:

```compile_fail,E0532
// This enum has two variants.
enum Number {
    // This variant has no fields.
    Zero,
    // This variant has one field.
    One(u32)
}

// Assuming x is a Number we can pattern match on its contents.
match Number::Zero {
    Number::Zero(inside) => {}
    Number::One(inside) => {}
}
```

The pattern match `Zero(inside)` is incorrect because the `Zero` variant
contains no fields, yet the `inside` name attempts to bind the first field of
the enum.
