#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

Blocks in constants may only contain items (such as constant, function
definition, etc...) and a tail expression. Erroneous code example:

```
const FOO: i32 = { let x = 0; x }; // 'x' isn't an item!
```

To avoid it, you have to replace the non-item object:

```
const FOO: i32 = { const X : i32 = 0; X };
```
