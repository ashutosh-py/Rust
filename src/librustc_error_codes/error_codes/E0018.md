#### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

The value of static and constant integers must be known at compile time. You
can't cast a pointer to an integer because the address of a pointer can vary.

For example, if you write:

```compile_fail,E0658
static MY_STATIC: u32 = 42;
static MY_STATIC_ADDR: usize = &MY_STATIC as *const _ as usize;
static WHAT: usize = (MY_STATIC_ADDR^17) + MY_STATIC_ADDR;
```

Then `MY_STATIC_ADDR` would contain the address of `MY_STATIC`. However,
the address can change when the program is linked, as well as change
between different executions due to ASLR, and many linkers would
not be able to calculate the value of `WHAT`.

On the other hand, static and constant pointers can point either to
a known numeric address or to the address of a symbol.

```
static MY_STATIC: u32 = 42;
static MY_STATIC_ADDR: &'static u32 = &MY_STATIC;
const CONST_ADDR: *const u8 = 0x5f3759df as *const u8;
```

This does not pose a problem by itself because they can't be
accessed directly.
