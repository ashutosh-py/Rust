error: type alias is never used: `Unused`
  --> $DIR/type-alias.rs:4:1
   |
LL | type Unused = u8;
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_Unused`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore helps signal to the reader that the type alias may still serve
           a purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect (e.g. the type alias
           is only used through FFI or used only for its effect when dropped)
note: the lint level is defined here
