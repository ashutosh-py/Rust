error: field is never read: `guard`
  --> $DIR/drop-only-field-issue-81658.rs:15:5

LL |     guard: MutexGuard<'a, T>,
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_guard`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore helps signal to the reader that the field may still serve
           a purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect (e.g. the field
           is only used through FFI or used only for its effect when dropped)
note: the lint level is defined here
