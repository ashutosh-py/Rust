error: function is never used: `foo`
  --> $DIR/basic.rs:4:4
   |
LL | fn foo() {
   |    ^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_foo`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore helps signal to the reader that the function may still serve
           a purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect (e.g. the function
           is only used through FFI or used only for its effect when dropped)
note: the lint level is defined here
