error: variant is never constructed: `Bar`
  --> $DIR/unused-struct-variant.rs:8:5
   |
LL |     Bar(B),
   |     ^^^^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_Bar`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore helps signal to the reader that the variant may still serve
           a purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect (e.g. the variant
           is only used through FFI or used only for its effect when dropped)
note: the lint level is defined here
  --> $DIR/unused-struct-variant.rs:1:9
   |
LL | #![deny(unused)]
   |         ^^^^^^
   = note: `#[deny(dead_code)]` implied by `#[deny(unused)]`

error: aborting due to previous error
