error: enum is never used: `E`
  --> $DIR/empty-unused-enum.rs:3:6
   |
LL | enum E {}
   |      ^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_E`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore helps signal to the reader that the enum may still serve
           a purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect (e.g. the enum
           is only used through FFI or used only for its effect when dropped)
note: the lint level is defined here

LL | #![deny(unused)]
   |         ^^^^^^
   = note: `#[deny(dead_code)]` implied by `#[deny(unused)]`

error: aborting due to previous error
