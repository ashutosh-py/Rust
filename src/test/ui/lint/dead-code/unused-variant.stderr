error: variant is never constructed: `Variant1`
  --> $DIR/unused-variant.rs:5:5
   |
LL |     Variant1,
   |     ^^^^^^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_Variant1`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore helps signal to the reader that the variant may still serve
           a purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect (e.g. the variant
           is only used through FFI or used only for its effect when dropped)
note: the lint level is defined here
