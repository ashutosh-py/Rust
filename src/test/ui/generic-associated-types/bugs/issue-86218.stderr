error[E0477]: the type `impl Stream<Item = i32>` does not fulfill the required lifetime

note: type must outlive the lifetime `'s` as defined here as required by this binding

error[E0277]: the trait bound `!: Stream` is not satisfied
  --> $DIR/issue-86218.rs:24:21
   |
LL |     fn foo<'s>() -> Self::InnerStream<'s> { todo!() }
   |                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Stream` is not implemented for `!`
   |
   = note: this trait is implemented for `()`
   = note: this error might have been caused by changes to Rust's type-inference algorithm (see issue #48950 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48950> for more information)
   = help: did you intend to use the type `()` here instead?
