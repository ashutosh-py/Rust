error[E0277]: the trait bound `u32: Plus<Const>` is not satisfied

LL |     a.plus(b)
   |       ^^^^^^^ the trait `Plus<Const>` is not implemented for `u32`

note: the trait `Plus<Not>` is implemented for `u32`, but that implementation is not `const`

LL |     a.plus(b)
   |       ^^^^^^^
   = help: the following other types implement trait `Plus<Not>`:
             <i32 as Plus<Const>>
             <u32 as Plus<Not>>

error[E0015]: cannot call non-const fn `<u32 as Plus<Const>>::plus` in constant functions

   = note: calls in constant functions are limited to constant functions, tuple structs and tuple variants
