// This is a minified example from Crater breakage observed when attempting to
// stabilize never type, nstoddard/webgl-gui @ 22f0169f.
//
// This particular test case currently fails as the inference to `()` rather
// than `!` happens as a result of an `as` cast, which is not currently tracked.
// Crater did not find many cases of this occuring, but it is included for
// awareness.
//
// This is a bug.
