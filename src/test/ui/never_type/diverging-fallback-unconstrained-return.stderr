error[E0277]: the trait bound `!: UnitReturn` is not satisfied

   |                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `UnitReturn` is not implemented for `!`

   = note: this trait is implemented for `()`
   = note: this error might have been caused by changes to Rust's type-inference algorithm (see issue #48950 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48950> for more information)
   = help: did you intend to use the type `()` here instead?
note: required by a bound in `unconstrained_return`
