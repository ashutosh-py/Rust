error: future cannot be sent between threads safely

   |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ future created by async block is not `Send`
   |
   = help: the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `(dyn Any + Send + 'static)`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

   |                               ^^^^^^ await occurs here, with `Client(Box::new(true))` maybe used later
...

   |     - `Client(Box::new(true))` is later dropped here
help: consider moving this into a `let` binding to create a shorter lived borrow
