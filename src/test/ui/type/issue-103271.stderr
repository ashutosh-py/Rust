error[E0599]: the function or associated item `len` exists for reference `&[_]`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied
  --> $DIR/issue-103271.rs:3:26

LL |     let length = <&[_]>::len;
   |                          ^^^ function or associated item cannot be called on `&[_]` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
   |
   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `&[_]: ExactSizeIterator`
           which is required by `&mut &[_]: ExactSizeIterator`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope
help: the following trait is implemented but not in scope; perhaps add a `use` for it:
   |
LL | use object::read::read_ref::ReadRef;
   |
help: the function `len` is implemented on `[_]`
   |
LL |     let length = <[_]>::len;
