error: field is never read: `b`
  --> $DIR/union-lint-dead-code.rs:5:5
   |
LL |     b: bool,
   |     ^^^^^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_b`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore signals that this field serves some other purpose
           even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect. (e.g. for its effect
           when dropped or in foreign code)
note: the lint level is defined here

LL | #![deny(dead_code)]
   |         ^^^^^^^^^

error: aborting due to previous error
