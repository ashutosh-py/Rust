warning: type alias is never used: `Z`
  --> $DIR/issue-37515.rs:5:1
   |
LL | type Z = dyn for<'x> Send;
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_Z`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore helps signal to the reader that the type alias may still serve
           a purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect (e.g. the type alias
           is only used through FFI or used only for its effect when dropped)
note: the lint level is defined here

   = note: `#[warn(dead_code)]` implied by `#[warn(unused)]`
