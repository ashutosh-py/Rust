warning: struct is never constructed: `S`

LL |         $b $a;
   |              ^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_S`
...
LL |     m!(S struct);
   |     ------------- in this macro invocation
   |
   = note: the leading underscore helps signal to the reader that the struct may still serve
           a purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect (e.g. the struct
           is only used through FFI or used only for its effect when dropped)
note: the lint level is defined here

LL | #![warn(unused)]
   |         ^^^^^^
   = note: `#[warn(dead_code)]` implied by `#[warn(unused)]`
   = note: this warning originates in the macro `m` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
