warning: variant is never constructed: `Void`
  --> $DIR/derive-uninhabited-enum-38885.rs:13:5
   |
LL |     Void(Void),
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_Void`
   |
   = note: the leading underscore helps signal to the reader that the variant may still serve
           a purpose even if it isn't used in a way that we can detect (e.g. the variant
           is only used through FFI or used only for its effect when dropped)
   = note: `-W dead-code` implied by `-W unused`
