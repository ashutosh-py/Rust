   = note: implementing a foreign trait is only possible if at least one of the types for which it is implemented is local, and no uncovered type parameters or associated types appear before that first local type
   = note: in this case, 'before' refers to the following order: `impl<..> ForeignTrait<T1, ..., Tn> for T0`, where `T0` is the first and `Tn` is the last
