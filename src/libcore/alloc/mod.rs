/// An implementation of `AllocRef` can allocate, reallocate, and
/// deallocate arbitrary blocks of data described via `Layout`.
///
/// `AllocRef` is designed to be implemented on ZSTs, references, or
/// smart pointers because having an allocator like `MyAlloc([u8; N])`
/// cannot be moved, without updating the pointers to the allocated
/// memory.
///
/// Some of the methods require that a memory block be *currently
/// allocated* via an allocator. This means that:
///
/// * the starting address for that memory block was previously
///   returned by a previous call to an allocation method (`alloc`,
///   `alloc_zeroed`) or reallocation method (`realloc`), and
///
/// * the memory block has not been subsequently deallocated, where
///   blocks are deallocated either by being passed to a deallocation
///   method (`dealloc`) or by being passed to a reallocation method
///  (see above) that returns `Ok`.
///
/// A note regarding zero-sized types and zero-sized layouts: many
/// methods in the `AllocRef` trait state that allocation requests
/// must be non-zero size, or else undefined behavior can result.
///
/// * If an `AllocRef` implementation chooses to return `Ok` in this
///   case (i.e., the pointer denotes a zero-sized inaccessible block)
///   then that returned pointer must be considered "currently
///   allocated". On such an allocator, *all* methods that take
///   currently-allocated pointers as inputs must accept these
///   zero-sized pointers, *without* causing undefined behavior.
///
/// * In other words, if a zero-sized pointer can flow out of an
///   allocator, then that allocator must likewise accept that pointer
///   flowing back into its deallocation and reallocation methods.
///
/// Some of the methods require that a layout *fit* a memory block.
/// What it means for a layout to "fit" a memory block means (or
/// equivalently, for a memory block to "fit" a layout) is that the
/// following two conditions must hold:
///
/// 1. The block's starting address must be aligned to `layout.align()`.
///
/// 2. The block's size must fall in the range `[use_min, use_max]`, where:
///
///    * `use_min` is `layout.size()`, and
///
///    * `use_max` is the capacity that was returned.
///
/// Note that:
///
///  * the size of the layout most recently used to allocate the block
///    is guaranteed to be in the range `[use_min, use_max]`, and
///
///  * a lower-bound on `use_max` can be safely approximated by a call to
///    `usable_size`.
///
///  * if a layout `k` fits a memory block (denoted by `ptr`)
///    currently allocated via an allocator `a`, then it is legal to
///    use that layout to deallocate it, i.e., `a.dealloc(ptr, k);`.
///
///  * if an allocator does not support overallocating, it is fine to
///    simply return `layout.size()` as the allocated size.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The `AllocRef` trait is an `unsafe` trait for a number of reasons, and
/// implementors must ensure that they adhere to these contracts:
///
/// * Pointers returned from allocation functions must point to valid memory and
///   retain their validity until at least one instance of `AllocRef` is dropped
///   itself.
///
/// * Cloning or moving the allocator must not invalidate pointers returned
///   from this allocator. Cloning must return a reference to the same allocator.
///
/// * `Layout` queries and calculations in general must be correct. Callers of
///   this trait are allowed to rely on the contracts defined on each method,
///   and implementors must ensure such contracts remain true.
///
/// Note that this list may get tweaked over time as clarifications are made in
/// the future.
