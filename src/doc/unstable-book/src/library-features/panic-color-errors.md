# `panic_color_errors`

This feature has no tracking issue yet.

------------------------

With this feature enabled, error messages generated during panics are highlighted for improved visibility and quick identification. By employing color highlighting, developers can easily distinguish error messages from other output, making debugging more efficient and intuitive. This is optional and can be toggled on or off using a dedicated function. The default behaviour is to highlight the errors when there's a terminal.
