    /// something like `&'1 u32` where `'1` is a universal region. But
    /// the type of the return slot `_0` is something like `&'2 u32`
    /// where `'2` is an existential region variable. The type checker
    /// requires that `&'2 u32 = &'1 u32` -- but at what point? In the
    /// older NLL analysis, we required this only at the entry point
    /// to the function. By the nature of the constraints, this wound
    /// up propagating to all points reachable from start (because
    /// `'1` -- as a universal region -- is live everywhere). In the
    /// newer analysis, though, this doesn't work: `_0` is considered
    /// dead at the start (it has no usable value) and hence this type
    /// equality is basically a no-op. Then, later on, when we do `_0
    /// = &'3 y`, that region `'3` never winds up related to the
    /// universal region `'1` and hence no error occurs. Therefore, we
    /// use Locations::All instead, which ensures that the `'1` and
    /// `'2` are equal everything. We also use this for other
    /// user-given type annotations; e.g., if the user wrote `let mut
    /// x: &'static u32 = ...`, we would ensure that all values
    /// assigned to `x` are of `'static` lifetime.

    /// The span points to the place the constraint arose. For example,
    /// it points to the type in a user-given type annotation. If
    /// there's no sensible span then it's DUMMY_SP.
