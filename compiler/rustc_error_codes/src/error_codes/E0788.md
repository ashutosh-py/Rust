The `AsRepr` trait was implemented explicitly.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0788
#![feature(enum_as_repr)]

enum Number {
    Zero,
    One,
    Other(u8),
}

impl core::enums::AsRepr for Number {} // error!
```

The `AsRepr` trait is a special trait built-in to the compiler for data-free
enum types. This trait is automatically implemented for types as needed by the
compiler, and it is currently disallowed to explicitly implement it for a type.

If you need a type to implement `AsRepr`, you should ensure that it is an enum
type, that it has an explicit numeric `repr` attribute, and that all of its
variants are data-free.

Working example:

```
#![feature(enum_as_repr)]

#[repr(u8)]
enum Number {
    Zero,
    One,
}
```
