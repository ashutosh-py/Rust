A trait which can only be derived for data-free enums was being derived for a
type other than a data-free enum.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0789
#![feature(enum_as_repr)]

#[derive(core::enums::FromRepr)]
enum Number {
    Zero,
    NonZero(core::num::NonZeroU8),
}
```

Types may only have this trait derived if all of the following are true:
1. The type must be an enum.
1. The enum must be data-free (i.e. have no variants which are struct-like or
   tuple-like).
1. The type must have an explicit repr of an integer type.

Working example:

```
#![feature(enum_as_repr)]

#[derive(core::enums::FromRepr)]
#[repr(u8)]
enum Number {
    Zero,
    One,
}
```
