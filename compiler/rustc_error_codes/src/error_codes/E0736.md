Functions marked with the `#[naked]` attribute are restricted in what other
code generation attributes they may be marked with.

The following code generation attributes are incompatible with `#[naked]`:

  * `#[inline]`
  * `#[track_caller]`
  * `#[target_feature]`

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0736
#[inline]
#[naked]
fn foo() {}
```

These incompatibilities are due to the fact that naked functions impose
deliberately strict restrictions regarding the code that the compiler is
allowed to produce for this function.
