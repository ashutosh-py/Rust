A scalable SIMD type was used in a context where they cannot exist. Scalable
SIMD types exist in a place that is somewhere between `Sized` and `Unsized`
therefore have restrictions on the uses. A scalable SIMD type can't exist in any
of the following:

* Struct
* Enum variant
* Union
* Compound type.
