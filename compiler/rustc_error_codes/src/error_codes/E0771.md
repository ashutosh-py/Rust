A non-`'static` lifetime was used in a const parameter type. This is
currently not allowed.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0771
#![feature(const_generics)]

fn function_with_str<'a, const STRING: &'a str>() {} // error!
```

To fix this issue, considering changing the lifetime to `'static`:

```
#![feature(const_generics)]

fn function_with_str<const STRING: &'static str>() {} // ok!
```
