The `since` value in a stability attribute is either missing
or does not parse to a version string.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0542
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "foo")]

#[stable(feature = "foo")] // missing
fn _stable1() {}

#[stable(feature = "foo", since = "bar")] // invalid
fn _stable2() {}

#[rustc_const_stable(feature = "foo")] // missing
fn _const1() {}

#[rustc_const_stable(feature = "foo", since = "bar")] // invalid
fn _const2() {}

#[stable(feature = "foo", since = "1.0.0")]
#[rustc_deprecated(reason = "bar")] // missing
fn _deprecated1() {}

#[stable(feature = "foo", since = "1.0.0")]
#[rustc_deprecated(reason = "qux", since = "bar")] // invalid
fn _deprecated2() {}
```

To fix this issue, you need to provide the `since` field. Example:

```
#![feature(staged_api)]
#![stable(since = "1.0.0", feature = "foo")]

#[stable(feature = "foo", since = "1.0.0")] // ok!
fn _stable() {}

#[rustc_const_stable(feature = "foo", since = "1.0.0")] // ok!
fn _const() {}

#[stable(feature = "foo", since = "1.0.0")]
#[rustc_deprecated(reason = "qux", since = "1.0.0")] // ok!
fn _deprecated() {}
```
